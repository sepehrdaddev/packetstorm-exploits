able to view an "account_activations/edit?token=" URI, the attacker can
create an approved user account associated with an email address that has an
arbitrary domain name.

The attacker can arbitrarily register on the portal with the e-mail address
of a company he wants and use the user account by unauthorized approval of
that e-mail address.
