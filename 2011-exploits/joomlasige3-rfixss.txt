### Note:

* Another web application bug is the RFI bug, which can be very dangerous
And stands for Remote File Inclusion, which directly executes loose scripts
on the server
Also, this security hole is created by programmer errors
And you must be fluent in programming language to secure and prevent this
bug
And you have to control the inputs of the application and use powerful
firewalls

* This bug is one of the most dangerous bugs and the access that the
intruder can gain using this bug is the implementation of Shell script
In fact, by running Shell script, it will have relatively complete access
to the Target site server
If we want to explain it in text, the hacker will execute the shell by
giving a link from Shell script in txt format to the input of the
vulnerable site.

* what's the solution ?
Check the file entered by the user from a list and enter it if the file was
in the list. Example :
<?php
$files=array('test.gif');
if(in_array($_GET['file'], $files)){
include ($_GET['file']);
}
?>
* If you are a server administrator, turn off allow_url_fopen from the file.

* Or do it with the ini_set command. Only for (RFI)
<?php
ini_set('allow_url_fopen ', 'Off');
?>

* We can use the strpos command to check that if the address is: // http,
the file will not be enclosed (it can only block RFI)
<?php
$strpos = strpos($_GET['url'],'http://');
if(!$strpos){
include($_GET['url']);
}
?>

* Using str_replace we can give the given address from two characters "/",
"." Let's clean up.
<?php
$url=$_GET['url'];
$url = str_replace("/", "", $url);
$url = str_replace(".", "", $url);
include($url);
?>
