PoC:

We have iframe and html injection in TinyMCE 5.

Iframe allow in the TinyMCE:

I wrote to support TinyMCE with this question and got a helpful answer:

If you wish to disallow this, you can set invalid_elements: 'iframe'
in the parameters object passed to the tinymce.init function. (c)

I use for example demo TinyMCE and Plone Cms with TinyMCE.

Our iframe and html injection on the demo:

Insert - Media - Embed - our iframe code or html.

In the demo Plone Cms:

Insert - Image - Caption - our iframe code or html.

We can also inject code into the Table.

If a simple user can inject his code into these fields, then he can
use it for phishing,deface and other things.

I did another interesting test.

I used for test www.project.co in "Discussion", because they use
TinyMCE. On the demo panel we have simple editor without
media,pictures and table. You have limited options.

But we can try use method POST. This works in the 70%. In the example
we will use the div tag and attributes for tag.
